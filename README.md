# Background

You work at a specialty foods import company that wants to expand into gourmet chocolate bars. Your boss needs your team to research this market to inform your initial approach to potential suppliers. After finding valuable chocolate bar ratings online, you need to explore if the chocolate bars with the highest ratings share any characteristics that could help you narrow your search for suppliers (e.g., cacao percentage, bean country of origin, etc.)

# Your challenge
Create a report to summarize your research. Include:

- What is the average rating by country of origin?
- How many bars were reviewed for each of those countries?
- Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
- Is the cacao bean's origin an indicator of quality?
- [Optional] How does cocoa content relate to rating? What is the average cocoa content for bars with higher ratings (above 3.5)?
- [Optional 2] Your research indicates that some consumers want to avoid bars with lecithin. Compare the average rating of bars with and without lecithin (L in the ingredients).
- Summarize your findings.

# Summary

1. By one hand, the top 5 average rating countries of origin are: Tobago, China, Sao Tome & Principe, Solomon Islands and Congo, but these countries are between the lowest count of reviewed. By the other hand, **the top 5 count of reviewed countries are: Venezuela, Peru, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Madagascar.** 
2. **Cacao bean's origin from Venezuela, Peru, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Madagascar have the highest rating**. So cacao bean's origin seems to be and indicator of quality.
3. There is a relationship between the cocoa content in the chocolate bars and the ratings. This means that **if the chocolate bar contains cocoa, it has a higher rating on average.** And **most best rating chocolate bars have on average between 70 and 71 percentage of cocoa content.**
4. **The chocolate bars that do not contain lecithin have, on average, a higher rating** than the chocolate bars that do have lecithin.
